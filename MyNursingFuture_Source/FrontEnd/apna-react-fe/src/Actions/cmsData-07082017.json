With passion and resilience they faced their challenges head on and found ways to overcome them.</p><p>Their stories were inspirational to us. This section hopes to gather that insight and hard won wisdom into a single resource to provide guidance and support for nurses trying to find their way in primary health care nursing.</p>",

The scope of practice for nurses in\r\nprimary health care continues to evolve and grow, and enables nurses to showcase\r\nmore than just their clinical expertise. It drives nurses to expand their\r\nnon-clinical skillsets by providing opportunities to interact with the\r\ncommunity to improve health outcomes, understand referral pathways and act as\r\nthe vital connection in the patient journey as care coordinator, and to\r\ninfluence by representing the profession on health and government committees.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">My Nursing Future provides nurses and future\r\nnurses with a guide into the different realms of primary health care.

                        "text": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Where do we begin? The Framework was developed\r\nusing an <font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">evidence-based and rigorous approach.<o:p></o:p></font></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">It all began with a literature review. This was used to identify what career and\r\neducation pathways were available for nurses and health professionals (both\r\nnational and international), and how the Australian nursing workforce could\r\nbenefit from a similar framework for nurses working in primary health care.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">From here on, an environmental scan was conducted to understand the areas of primary\r\nhealth care in which nurses had a predominant role. This identifying settings\r\nsuch as refugee health, community health, Aboriginal Health Services, general\r\npractice, correctional health, residential care and many more.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">So now the team had an idea of what other\r\nFrameworks looked like and the areas of primary health care nursing that should\r\nbe further investigated, but we still needed to learn about what the Framework\r\nneeded to address and how current and future nurses would access this\r\ninformation.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">A consultation\r\nwas conducted from early 2016 through to July 2017. This included a number of\r\nmethods; face-to-face workshops,\r\ninterviews, prototype testing, online consultation, focus groups and conference\r\npresentations. Key participants included those with expertise across a\r\nrange of primary health care settings and with a variety of focus areas,\r\nincluding clinical, policy, management, research and education.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">The need for a Framework and resources was\r\nclearly articulated by all participants and demonstrated a current gap, while\r\noutlining the many and varied potential impacts the Framework would have on\r\nrecruitment and retention of nurses in primary health care settings.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Most significantly, all stakeholders saw value\r\nin the Framework to improve the perceived value and professionalism of the nursing role\r\nin primary health care. Other major themes consistent across the range of\r\nconsultations included the positive impact the Framework would have on\r\nstrengthening undergraduate nursing cirriculums and clinical placements, the\r\ndevelopment of transition support programs, supporting recruitment and\r\nretention, identifying relevant formal and informal education pathways and options,\r\ndescribing the breadth of nursing roles, the opportunities for career\r\nprogression, and as a promotional tool.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Current and future nurses told us the way they\r\naccess career and education information is predominantly via mobile phone. So\r\nwe invited nurses to work with APNA to develop a mobile-responsive website which would contain resources,\r\ninformation, contacts and visual career pathways, for nurses to explore and\r\nnavigate the potential of working in primary health care.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Everything down to the My Nursing Future logo,\r\nthe colours in the self-assessment report, the wording in the self-assessment,\r\nvideos of nurses working in primary health care, career advice articles, and\r\nthe words of wisdom, were all developed by current and future nurses.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=\"text-align:left\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span lang=\"EN-AU\" style=\"line-height: 107%;\">APNA formally acknowledges all of the\r\norganisations and individuals involved in this project. We also acknowledge the\r\nproject team who has worked tirelessly to represent your ideas and knowledge on\r\nthe primary health care nursing workforce – Emily Wheeler, Dr Jacqui Richmond,\r\nLinda Govan and Brie Woods.</span><br></p>",

Nurses are considered to be a key part of the forthcoming changes in the delivery of primary health care in this country.</p><p>General practice nursing offers a great opportunity to work at the forefront of primary care in Australia in a variety of contexts, such as rural, urban, large or small practices or with discrete populations, such as migrant or refugee groups. Working collaboratively in a team setting as a respected health professional has ensured that general practice nursing is a valid and rewarding career choice for many nurses.</p><p><br></p>",
